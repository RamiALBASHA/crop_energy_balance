# crop_energy_balance

`crop_energy_balance` is an open-source package for simulating the energy balance of uniform crop canopies.
The package formalisms rely on the the generalized multi-component Penman-Monteith equation developed by
[Lhomme et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.01.038).
The theoretical basis of the formalisms in this package were validated in a scientific paper by 
[Albasha et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2024.110221).
